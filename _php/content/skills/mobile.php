	<p>
		We develop webview apps. That means that all the code, logic and 
		data is stored in the cloud, with a small lightweight native app
		which works as well on Android as it does on iPhone, iPad and 
		old school laptops.

<h3>Massif Monitor on your Android device.</h3>
<p>We remotely install our clever little Linux service on any kind of devices you choose.
Massif Monitor gathers data about your device and sends it to a cloud based database.
You use practically any web browser to monitor your device in real time.
Massif Droid is a new Android App we are developing. The baseline device is the Eken T01.
This App is simply a webview model, allowing the monitor to work natively on any android 
tablet like the Samsung Galaxy or phone like the Nexus.
