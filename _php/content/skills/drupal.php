	<h1>15 years using PHP to develop Web Applications</h1>
	
	<p>We have extensive experience using PHP and MySQL to create Web Applications and APIs 
		(example <a title="Massif AI" target="_blank" href="http://massif-ai.com/">Massif AI</a>).
		This makes it easy to dive into Open Source LAMP CMSs.
		</p>
	
	<p>Before deciding that WordPress would be our Open Source CMS platform of choice, we 
		used Drupal. Drupal is far more complex software than WordPress and was excellent
		for rolling out web applications with advanced functionality very quickly.
		It's downside is that the interface is difficult for non-developer users to
		understand.</p>
